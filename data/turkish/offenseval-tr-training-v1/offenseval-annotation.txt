Detailed annotation guidelines for the Turkish data can be found 
at <https://coltekin.github.io/offensive-turkish/guidelines.html>.
Please note that we only use the top level annotation in this shared
task. Meaning we have two labels:

OFF     The tweet contains a form of non-acceptable language (profanity)
        or a targeted offense, which can be veiled or direct. 
NOT     The tweet does not containe any offensive statement.
